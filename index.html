    <h1><bold>Social Movements in the U.S. 2017-2018</bold></h1>
      
    <p>Throughout U.S. history, there are been various social movements that have been the catalysts of change and have
      made the world what it is today. Direct actions such as protests, rallies, marches, and public demonstrations have
      been utilized to propel such movements forward. This data visualization will show how many people have been in
      attendance at protests that took place in 2017 for various social movements in U.S. cities.
      It will also depict what percentage of the population this number makes up, in order to determine how many people
      are needed to take action in order to bring about change.</p>
